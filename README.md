# flashlight

flashlight is a fast, flexible machine learning library written entirely in C++ from the Facebook AI Research Speech team and the creators of Torch and DeepSpeech. It uses the [ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) tensor library and features just-in-time compilation with modern C++. flashlight supports both CPU (still in active development) and GPU backends for maximum portability, and has an emphasis on efficiency and scale.

All documentation (including build/install instructions) can be found [here](https://fl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
