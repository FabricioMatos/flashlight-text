# flashlight

flashlight is a fast, flexible machine learning library written entirely in C++
from FAIR Speech Team and the creators of Torch and DeepSpeech. It uses the
[ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) tensor library and features
just-in-time compilation with modern C++.  We support both CPU and GPU backends
for maximum efficiency and scale.  

All the documentation (including installation instructions) can be found
